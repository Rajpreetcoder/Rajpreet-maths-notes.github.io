# Taylor Series

 It is the function of an infinite sum of terms in increasing order of degree. Taylor series of **Polynomial** function is a **Polynomial**. 

**_Ex. with respect. to **Taylor Series**_**

Let _f_ be a **function** with derivatives of all orders throughout some interval containing _a_ as an interior point. Then the **Taylor series generated by _f_ at _x=a_ is** 
```
$$
\displaystyle\sum_{k=0}^infinity
$$
```

 When the **Taylor series** is centered at **Zero** it is known as **Maclaurin Series**.
