# Taylor Series

 This shows how functions that are infinitely differentiable generate power series called **Taylor Series**. In many case, these  series can provide useful polynomial approximately of generating functions. 

 When the **Taylor series** is centered at **Zero** it is known as **Maclaurin Series**.
