# Taylor Series

 It is the function of an infinite sum of terms in increasing order of degree. Taylor series of **Polynomial** function is a **Polynomial**. 

**_Ex. with respect. to **Taylor Series**_**

Let _f_ be a **function** with derivatives of all orders throughout some interval containing _a_ as an interior point. Then the **Taylor series generated by _f_ at _x=a_ is** 

$$
\displaystyle\sum_{k=0}^{infinity}\frac{f^k(a)}{k!} (x-a)^k= f(a)+ f'(a) (x-a) +\frac{f''(a)}{2!} (x-a)^2 +.... +\frac{f^n(a)}{n!} (x-a) ^n+..., 
$$                                                              
                                                             
 _When the **Taylor series** is centered at **Zero** it is known as **Maclaurin Series**._
 
 The **Maclaurin series generated by _f_ is**
 
 $$
 \displaystyle\sum_{k=0}^{infinity}\frac{f^k(0)}{k!} x^k = f(0)+ f'(0)x+\frac{f''(0) }{2!} x^2x +.... + \frac{f^n(0)}{n!} x^n+...,

# Question relevant to **Taylor series**
Find the **Taylor series** generated by

$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{x}
$$
                                       
at a=2. Where, if anywhere, does the series converge to
                                       
$$
\frac{1}{x} ? 
$$
 
**Solution**
We need to find f(2), f'(2), f''(2),........ Taking derivatives we get
      f(x) =
            
             $$
             X^{-1}
             $$
